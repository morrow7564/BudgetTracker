Smart Money is an online app for those who want to be smarter with their money. We want everyone to be able to easily keep track of their spending. Users can sign up and record their transactions into categories allowing you to see how much you spend on certain items. This allows you to better budget your spending. Users can also keep track of bills and their due dates. We also provide great resources. Our loans section helps you calculate monthly payments and total payment amount based on your amount, interest, and length. We also provide some helpful credit monitoring sites to help you with your credit and and help you become ready to make new purchases.
